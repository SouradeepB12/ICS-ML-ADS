# ICS-ML-ADS

Formulate Machine Learning algorithms to help intrusion detection systems and anomaly detection  systems  in  making  accurate  decisions  when  detecting  attacks  on  Industrial  Control Systems/Power Systems.

For the purpose of this project, we have considered using datasets relevant to power systems. 
The dataset selected is an Industrial Control System Cyber Attack Dataset obtained through a general search on Google's Dataset Search Engine. It was created by Uttam Adhikari, Shengyi Pan, and Tommy Morris in collaboration with Raymond Borges and Justin Beaver of Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL).
